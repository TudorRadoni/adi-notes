# ADXL327

We have done some measurements to make sure that everything is wired correctly. This also helped us decide what is the middle value for each axis (even though they are all the same). We didn't use the values from the datasheet because they used a 3V power supply and we used 3.3V, so the values are a tiny bit different.
