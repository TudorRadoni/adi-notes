# HDL - Day 3

We've been given a template to make it easier for us to make the IP. We made the necessary changes and we ran make 100 times. At some point, it worked ðŸ™„. Therefore, we also touched a bit on Makefiles.

## Tasks

1. Complete the given template
2. Build the project
3. Generate BOOT.BIN

## Tip of the day

Don't hit `make` unless you checked your code. It's not fun to make a project 100 times and have it fail every time because of a typo!
