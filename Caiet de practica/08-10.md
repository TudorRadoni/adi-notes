# Linux Drivers - Day 8

For the last part of the Linux drivers module, we implemented a buffer, so that we can read with a greater precision and at a constant rate (almost "guaranteed" thing). This way, we minimise the user space timing errors that can occur because of the scheduler and different priorities.

To do this, we modified some parts of the code and, in essence, we just optimised the driver and made the last step there was to make (at least for what the practice program was concerned). We hand-tested the buffer and made a really cool recap of everything, than we discussed with the mentors and everything was great.
