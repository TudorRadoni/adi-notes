# HDL - Day 1

## Project structure

- **system_constr.xdc**: in constraints, we tell the FPGA pins and what will be connected there. We also put the delay/timing between clock and data, for example
- **system_top.v** _(v = verilog)_: here, we specify the direction of the signals, similar to a wrapper over everything we write. We know that this goes in and that this goes out etc. We divide this module into IPs
- **system_bd.tcl**: facem legaturi intre module. daca avem un modul care are 2 iesiri si unul care are 2 intrari, facem legaturile intre ele. aici facem si legaturile cu pinii de pe FPGA. asta e un script pe care il folosim in loc de GUI-ul din Vivado
- **system_bd.tcl**: we make the connections between modules. Should we have a module with 2 outputs and one with 2 inputs, then here we make the connections between these two. Here we also make the connections with the FPGA pins. This is a script that we use instead of the GUI from Vivado, which makes it a lot easier to setup the project
