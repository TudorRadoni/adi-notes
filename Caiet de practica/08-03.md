# HDL - Day 6

Today, we did a recap of the previous days. We touched a bit on the GUI of Vivado and we've seen all the connections between the modules. Nothing much today, it was more of an outro to the HDL part of the project.

## Oh, yeah, the project

I almost forgot! The mentors also made a cool presentation of the project and we've seen how everything works together. It was pretty cool, I must say. I'm really excited to see the final product! It gives a glance on how production works vs how we do things, which is important for us, as students.
