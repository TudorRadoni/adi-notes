# HDL - Day 4

We learned that the majority of the commits are something like:

- "asd"
- "merge"
- "mergeeee"
- "final"
- "alt final"

... and stuff like that, so we needed to redo all the commits.

In the end, all of us had 4 commits. The mentors taught us how to write the "perfect" commit message. We got hands-on experience with git rebase and git reset.
