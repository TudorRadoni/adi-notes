# Linux Drivers - Day 4

## Let's test the Zybo board

- change root's pwd: ```parolanoua```
- change the board's mac addr: add ```ethaddr=<MAC-ul nou>``` in ```/boot/uEnv.txt```
- get its ip: ```ip a```
- connect to it: ```ssh root@<ip>```

Done!

## Should one not see the device in  `/sys/bus/iio/devices`

Possible reasons:

- the code is not okay
- the device tree is not okay
- it's not selected in menuconfig

## Let's make a recap

### Kernel stuff

- downloaded the kernel
- made `driver.c` (aka ad5592r_s.c)
- modified the `Kconfig` (which makes the entry in menuconfig)
- modified the `Makefile`
- created the `uImage` (which is, in fact, the kernel itself)

### Device tree stuff

- created `file.dts` (aka zynq-zybo-z7-ad5592r.dts)
- used a Makefile to generate the blob `file.dtb` (aka zynq-zybo-z7-ad5592r.dtb)
- renamed `zynq-zybo-z7-ad5592r.dtb` to `devicetree.dtb`

### Zybo-related stuff

- made the SD Card using Rufus
  - it has 3 partitions:
    - **rootfs** (not visible from Windows)
    - **BOOT** (here we have BOOT.BIN, uImage and devicetree.dtb)
    - an empty partition
- copied the uImage and devicetree.dtb to the BOOT partition
- rebooted the board
