Today we learned how an embedded system boots, from the ZSBL to the Linux kernel. We also learned about the device tree and some basic concepts regarding this topic.

1. Mentor said: *"Tricky stuff"*
2. BOOT.BIN, image.ub, devicetree.dtb
3. Bootloaders:
ZSBL (zero stage boot loader): loads BOOT.BIN (FSBL.elf, uBoot.elf, optional *.bit)
FSBL (first stage boot loader): loads the PS (ii configureaza clock-urile si perifericele)
SSBL (second stage boot loader): loads kernel, devicetree.dtb, fs
